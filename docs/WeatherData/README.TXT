INTRODUCTION

The Weather Station Data Files contain meteorological data measured at 237
U.S. Weather stations for a period extending nominally from 1961 to 1990.
Exact collection dates vary by weather station. The files can be used with
the U.S. EPA PRZM and EXAMS models.  Each data set contains one "Daily Values
File" (.DVF), several "Hourly" values files (.Hnn), and one format file
(.TXT).

INSTALLATION

Weather Station Data Files contain the recorded weather data for 237
meteorological stations.  All executable (.exe) files were compressed using a
registered copy of WinZip Self-Extractor.  No other software is needed to
extract the data.  Each file can be decompressed or "unzipped" by simply
double-clicking the file name in Windows Explorer or My Computer.  The WinZip
Self-Extractor user interface will allow you to extract the data files to a 
local or network directory of your choice.  The default target directory is
C:\metdata.  Approximately 45 MB of available disk space is required to
decompress each self-extracting weather station data set.

_____________________________________________________________________________

FILE SPECIFICATION

When decompressed, the data files are stored as ASCII text (non-binary) files
and have the DOS file name extension "*.dvf" for daily values file, or
"*.hnn" for hourly values file.

The hourly data files contain recorded meteorological data from the following
sources:

  #1. Solar and Meteorological Surface Observation Network (SAMSON)
      1961-1990 data sets, Version 1.0, Sep 1993

  #2. National Solar Radiation Data base (NSRDB) version 1.1;
      NSRDB Hourly Data Files Text files downloaded from
      http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/hourly/
      -- provided updated radiation parameters.

  #3. EarthInfo NCDC Summary of the Day and Surface Airways, 2001 -- 
      provided daily and hourly values for precipitation, and daily
      evaporation.  Missing evaporation was calculated using the
      Kohler-Nordenson-Fox Class-A Evaporation Pan version of the Penman-
      Monteith equations.

  #4. Evapotranspiration (Et0) formulae based on: Crop Evapotranspiration -
      Guidelines for Computing Crop water requirements. FAO Irrigation and
      Drainage Paper 56 by Richard G. Allen, Luis S. Pereira, Dirk Raes, and
      Martin Smith. Water Resources, Development and Management Service,
      FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome,
      1998. ISBN 92-5-104219-5.  This book may be found online at
      http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.htm
          
Each directory contains "Hourly" values files (*.hnn), a "Daily Values File"
(*.dvf), and a format file (*.txt). The name of the file is of the form
"wnnnnn", where "nnnnn" represents the WBAN (Weather Bureau Army Navy)
identification number of the weather station. For more information on WBAN
numbers see http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/stationlocator.html
       
Gaps in the hourly data record were filled according to methods described in
National Solar Radiation Data Base User's Manual (1961-1990), NSRDB Volume 1,
September 1991, Section 5.2.1. The document may be downloaded from
http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/pubs/NSRDB/NSRDB_index.html. In general,

  #1. Gaps of less than 6 hours were filled by linear interpolation between
      points at both sides of the gap.
  #2. Gaps of 6 hours to 49 hours were filled by copying data from the 
      previous (or following) day.
  #3. Longer gaps of 50 hours to 8784 hours (one leap year) were filled by
      copying data for the same period from some other year.

The daily values were obtained by computing the mean over 24 hours, or by
adding the values over one day, as appropriate.

PRZM and EXAMS can use the "Daily Values File" data files (*.dvf).

All decompressed, "Daily Values File" data files (*.dvf) have the following
format:

*Hour of the day: The range of the hour of the day is 1h to 25h:
 1h-24h: line contains data for the hour
 25: line contains daily values

*Wh/m2: Watt hour meter^-2
 Watt hour meter^-2 is equivalent to 3.6e-3 MJoule meter^-2
 Watt hour meter^-2 is equivalent to 8.59845e-02 Langley

*kPa: kiloPascal
1 kiloPascal is equivalent to 10 millibar

Fields 26 and 27 represent daily totals. These fields are present
only when the hour of the day (field 3) is 25.

Generally, each value has one or more character flags associated with it.
When possible, the flags associated with the original datum are copied to
the Hourly Values File (*.hnn).

    'W' = Measured value (SAMSON flag)
    'B' = Calibrated (SAMSON flag)
    'D' = Deleted (SAMSON flag)
    'E' = Estimated.
    '-' = Missing value
    'R' = Datum from EarthInfo data 2001
    'S' = Datum from SAMSON version 1.0
    'T' = Datum from SAMSON version 1.1
    'U' = Unlimited in Visibility or Ceiling Height or
          Short-gap interpolation with either of the
          endpoints being Unlimited or Cirroform.
    'Z' = Cirroform in Ceiling Height data
    '?' = Value is undefined, given the context,
          e.g., Dew point is undefined if the Relative Humidity is zero.
    '#' = If the station is above the Arctic Circle (Latitude 66.5 degrees North),
          then the region will be in darkness for a period of the year. This
          prevents the computation of, e.g., Daylight value of Global Horizontal
          Radiation and Reference Crop Evapotranspiration (Eto)
    'A' = Accumulation (SAMSON flag). The precipitation is distributed in the
          observation interval.

Missing values are denoted by '---' in the numeric value field and
flag value of '-'
